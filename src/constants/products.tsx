          I worked on an internal app to create and track Purchase/Sale orders.
          I designed a custom Excel-like UI to manage order items and built the user interface.

          I also helped connect the visual elements with the server-side infrastructure.
          Throughout the project, I followed agile methods and attended SCRUM meetings to track progress and issues using JIRA.
